# Plant Tracker for Android
Plant Tracker is a free Android Phone App for tracking your plant grows. Keeps track of waterings, feedings, custom events and clone lineage. Future implementations will include scheduled reminders, data point graphing and a desktop app for more plant analysis, looking at integrating automated sensor data collection.
